I never would've thought someone was here at 1:00 in the morning. / I couldn't even say why I myself am awake. / I guess I was just . . . thinking about things. / I want to do a lot with my life, I suppose, and I have so little time to do it. / I want to learn; I want to do; I want to understand. / I'm sorta trying to teach myself the basics of linear algebra in two weeks. Too ambitious? / I don't think so. I have access to finals and other materials; I think it's something I can pull off--but only if I'm serious about it this time. / There was a time about, oh, a while back, where I tried to do the same thing: teach myself linear algebra in two weeks. / I think I might've been able to pull it off had I not had full time work also. / It wasn't the time from work that killed me (though that, indeed, did take a lot from me). It was more that I was so physically and mentally drained that I didn't want to - / study for anything. It really frustrated me. I knew that I wanted to learn, but I couldn't muster the energy to study. / Suffice to say, those two weeks did NOT end well for me. / I was lucky enough that I didn't get burned for it. I mean, I did lose a bet, which means I owe someone pizza, but it's a small price to pay. / Because I'm going at it again. Nothing's going to stop me. I hope. / I don't . . . I don't actually know. I haven't felt this fired up about something in a long time. / I'm worried that I have all this ambition and no work to show for it. That I'm all talk and no bite, you know? / This wouldn't be the first time that I'd set my sights on something ambitious and then never took the first step towards climbing. / I've nothing against hard work. Honest. I somehow find myself enjoying the struggle. I know, I know, it's weird. / And even when it comes to things that I consider grand, like landing an internship with Google, I wouldn't feel nearly as accomplished than if I had to work for it. / There's something refining in the struggle. I can't describe it. / It's not that I wouldn't take the internship. Of course I would. I'm not an idiot. / But my point is, I want to fight for something. I want to sink my teeth into something meaty and hard to digest and just master it. / It's hard at times, especially when I'm up against something that I really don't have experience in. Like drawing! That's really hard. / I could spend the same amount of time in drawing as I could in, oh, electrical engineering and not make nearly the same progress. / I don't know if that's because of my background in engineering or because of natural tendencies or what, but, wow, are the arts hard. / But . . . I'd still love to be able to do them one day. / What if I wake up one day, real ambitious to start something, only to hit a major roadblock and give up? / That seems more sad than not trying at all, in some regards. Because what's the point of dreaming big if you never have the grit to see those dreams become a reality? / I love to dream. Dreaming is wonderful. I love thinking about all the wonderful little things I could do with my life, all the skills I could get, the talents I could develop. / And I want that. I want to be able to excel and reach for great things. / But even I'm not so naive as to believe that everything I've ever wanted is a fingertip away. / It's . . . I don't know. I don't know how to explain any of this. / I want things to be hard; I want things to be easy. I have no idea what I want to do with my life; I'll never have enough time to accomplish everything I want to do. / I can handle anything that comes my way; I'm inherently incapable of the grand things. / But I just . . . I don't know. / Can I really handle linear algebra in two weeks? Do I have it in me? / Man. / And there's that fear again. / I guess it's not a permanent thing, this ambition of mine. / I've been scarred from past experiences, I suppose. Times when I wanted to shoot high and hit the stars and then not even leaving the ground. / Some part of me still recoils from anything that I feel is beyond my ability because, well, what if I end up failing and ruin everything? / Technically, if I'm just experimenting with my own time and effort and money, the only thing I lose is the stuff I put into it. / But it's more than that. / Because I also hurt my ability to believe in myself. / I know, I know. Failure is probably inevitable. / I can't hit my first wall and say, ""Well! That's that. Looks like I'm not cut out to be a (insert any dream here)."" / And I get that. I really do. / I don't know. / Heh, I have no idea what I'm talking about. / Do you have any advice? / Something to offer beyond the Hallmark greetings cards? / It'd . . . be real nice if you hopped on about now. / You probably won't. You're asleep, like any normal, sane person would be. / I should be sleeping, too. Quit pretending like I'm doing something productive and just hit the hay. / I'm not sure I'll be able to, though, not for a while. I've got so much buzzing in my head that . . . well, I mean, the whole reason I hopped on here was because I couldn't - / sleep. I'd been in bed for at least an hour straight, probably longer, with my eyes closed but mind racing about all the possibilities. / When I finally sat up, I was a little disappointed to find I was more awake than when I'd tried to go to bed. / And I figured that if sleep really was going to be that hard to get, I might as well make something useful from my time. / Which . . . is really bad for me, now that I'm thinking about it / I have to be up early today, and I won't get to bed until late. I have a friend's birthday party, see. She's turning seventeen. So fun! / There's this haunted house thing that she invited me to, and since it's Halloween and all that fun stuff, I decided to go. / Proooobably not the best decision I could've made considering how easily I get scared, but I suppose that's part of the fun, right? All of us getting scared together? / If nothing else, it'll be nice to spend a few hours with my friend. We don't get to see each other very often. She lives about forty minutes away, which isn't the worst, but - / it makes frequent visits rather difficult. / And, heh, actually, I really should quit this about now. I feel like I talk like a normal person would, or at least how a normal person would talk if they were in a chat - / room, but I think it might be stilted data. I'm always worried about that. Eve is going to be better at soliloquizing than actual conversation. / Great for monologue spews, great for information dumps, but not so great when the whole point of this is to gather two-sided conversation data. / Which . . . yeah. / Thanks for listening to me. / I know that you're unaware of my existence, which is okay. I'm fine with that. / It was great to talk to you! / Maybe we'll run into each other later? / Hopefully when you're a little more active? / Heh. We'll see, we'll see. / But seriously, I'm calling it quits for today. See you around! / "	2018-10-15T07:44:36Z
