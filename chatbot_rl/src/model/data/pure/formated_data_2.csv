You want all of your friends to read the book because it was so good, but you also don't want them to read it because then they'll talk about the book with you and they might have totally different opinions about the book, which can be either good or bad. / 	2018-04-13T19:37:56Z
14707fe1-75fb-4e06-bd68-1e2545cf87e6	What's your favorite smell?		842e34da-02f5-4904-ace0-fe96083a3a1c	2018-04-14T00:40:09Z	Yes! Especially when I get attached to the characters of the book, and then they don't like that character. I feel like I need to defend the character. / Take Harry Potter for example, if my favorite character is Ron, and my friend thinks Ron is useless and doesn't add anything to the trio, I'll go off on my friend and feel a bit attacked because they don't like the character I like. Maybe it's a bit obsessive, but books are great. / 	2018-04-13T19:39:55Z

There are few movies that are done almost as well as books. / I haven't seen Ready Player One for this reason.

You have to look at things in a little different light.
