I wonder if since their blood makes people live forever if we could create cures for illnesses with unicorn blood / I'm curious your opinion on the new schedule changes to General Conference. / Specifically the 2 hour time change they announced. / I think it will be very good!  Bigger focus on teaching in the home.  I'm really excited to see and read the new curriculum they have planned for us to practice in our homes. / They have been getting so good with their new curriculums.  Should be really exciting! / I don't mean to blow up your chat, but need to get points somehow! / I'm curious as to how the scoring is going to go for this coming round. / They made it seem like they would send out an email fairly quickly, but they never did. / I'm really hoping that they will make the top scorer of each round win the Ipad Pro's, because if they do then eventually I should win. / Because you can't win more than one ipad so as long as you place like top 3 each round it'll guarentee you an ipad in at least one round. / I don't know how those top two people did it last round though, because they scored like 3 million.  And by the end of the round no one was even participating so it was ... / ... practically impossible to keep up. / I'm guessing they are both freshmen who had a ton of time on their hands to just rack up tons of points / My advice, just chat as much as possible this first week while people are active during this round before it starts to die down.  Because once it does, you won't be able to... / ... rack up points quickly at all. / I spoke with this one person yesterday who was typing what seemed to be like 200 words per minute. / Just blowing through conversation topics left and right. / I'm not sure what major you are, but I'm in the CS major and am thinking of joining a professors research study.  If you know of any good ones I'd love to hear about it! / I love conference weekend, but at the same time it can stink too because things you'd usually get done on Saturday you can't because you have to be home most of the day. / I spoke with someone else yesterday who had a funny name for talking to yourself on Chit Chat, he called it, ""Talking to the void"".  After doing it for over ten minutes it... / ... really does feel like you're just talking to the void. / I am currently updating my portfolio and have this one tiny feature that I'm trying to fix. / So I have a hire me page where you can select certain items that you'd like me to do for you and you enter your name and email and it sends me an email. / On my contact page though I have a button that just says, ""Email Me"" / if you click it, it has an href tag that calls ""mailto:"" followed by my email. / It's supposed to open up your default mailing source and have my email in the heading, but for some reason when I try to test it, it doesn't seem to work. / I don't know if I've just got some weird setting on my computer, or on chrome, or if it just isn't working outright. / I've been struggling to figure it out.  And when I look at examples of other people who have done it, it won't work for me still.  So I think it's got something to do with ... / ... my computer / I can't seem to figure out where in my settings I can change it though. / The problem is on mac System Preferences there is nothing regarding mailing settings. / And when I search about it online I just get information about fixing the problem on a windows machine.  Kind of frustrating. / Anyways, I'm planning on just assuming it would work on someone else's device and pushing it to my byu domain file manager. / Maybe I'll get on a computer at BYU that runs on Linux and see if it works then. / Dang, about 20 minutes now talking to the void.  Pretty exhilarating stuff. / Are you a bot? / I think that what I would really like to see is an AI that uses communication signals to determine how you are feeling based off of verbal cues and tone of voice. / And to be able to respond accordingly to you to help stabilize your mood. / That would be really cool if they could implement something like that into Alexa or Siri / I know that ""Eve"" (the name of this project) is supposed to be some sort of communication AI software for Alexa, but I'm not really sure what the exact purpose is. / As far as I know there are already many other projects much more sophisticated already in operation so I'm curious which specific niche of this market they are working on. / I think they should also tell us what kinds of conversations they would like us to have so that we can change our conversations to give them the most reliable information / possible. / Alrighty, well I'm going to head out.

Interesting thoughts on experience and reliving experiences / I wonder if it's even a guarantee that you'd experience something the same if you relived it / What if you went back and relived your favorite day of your life / And then it was not as good as it was the first time / THat would be a real downer / And I mean, not like you go back and it turns out differently the second time than it did the first / But you go back and everything happens EXACTLY as it did at first / But you don't enjoy it as much / For whatever reason / MAybe your mental state isn't as good / Or maybe your soul isn't as happy / Who knows / Just a thought / Ok, you are clearly not hrere / here / So I'm gonna go / Bye! / 	2018-09-21T05:51:39Z

There are a lot of causes in underdeveloped countries that I'd like to be a part of. / Another thing I'd do, since money is no object, is hack and shut down child pornography sites on the  dark web and work with organizations like Operation Underground Railroad. / OUR works to free the world from human traffickers. I think they have awesome goals and I'd work with them if money weren't a problem. / Okay, I guess you don't want to talk! Have a good one! / 	2018-04-23T15:29:55Z

The two most successful communist countries have been China and Cuba.  China, when it originally changed to a communist country failed / politically and economically, and slowly after they started turning away from communism did they start to become a super power.  Cuba has a similar back story / Cuba claimed to be communist after aggressive political sanctions from the USA, and mainly claimed to be communist to have protection from the USSR. / So in part both successful communist countries are actually not communist, but lean closer to socialist policies. / 	2018-09-15T03:01:25Z

My dog woke me up needing to use the bathroom. / Well... i'm guessing i'm just talking to myself. / I'm currently watching friends on Netflix just waiting to start studying for my test tomorrow / I've got like 2 tests this week and a project due on Friday too / I'm probably going to go here in like 5 minutes honestly / I just finished talking with potato (that's their screen name) for like an hour or so and am pretty beat. / Potato likes to talk haha / I got back from the vet with my little puppy about 2 hours ago.  We went in this morning to get here stitches removed from where they cut off her little back leg nubs, but / they forgot to cut off a couple of them, so I had to go back this afternoon to get the rest of the stitches out. / She was not a happy puppers. / She knew exactly where we were going during the car ride so she just kept squirming the whole ride. / She's just sleeping like sleeping beauty right now on my lap / Crazy how tired dogs are all the time. / Earlier today when I went on campus she somehow opened up her crate and started wandering around the house. / I got back to a box of goldfish open and she had eaten like 15 goldfish or so. / Such a pain to clean up haha / She seemed very happy however.  I think she enjoyed running around eating goldfish while I was gone / She made a little bit of a mess though which stinks because my parents are coming to town tomorrow which means I need to clean up.  But i also have a test tomorrow that I need / to finish prepping for. / I'll just do that later tonight I think / I keep wanting to get off chit chat, but it's been so difficult to find people on here recently that I want to make sure I take advantage of the time while I can / It's getting pretty difficult to keep up with some of the people on here that have a lot more time than me. / I've also got an interview on Thursday to prep for, another test on Friday, and a project due on Friday.  Although I'm almost done with the project so that helps things. / It's just going to be a long week probably / I'm like trying to type fast, but my dog is like right on my lap so I can't really rest my arms down like I usually would while fast typing / Makes it a little bit difficult / Darn, I really wish there was someone participating in this conversation so that I wasn't just talking to myself. / Responding to the prompt, I don't know what I would do if I had power for one day.  I would probably send a ton of aid and help to puerto rico to help with the terrible / situation there / But other than that i'm not sure what else could get accomplished with just one day politics being the way they are. / Besides executive orders there really isn't a lot that can get done in just a day. / Okay, well I'm getting pretty bored of just talking to myself. / I'm going to go / See you! / Have a great day / 	2018-10-09T22:24:40Z

Just because that's hard and the wand would make it way easier. / This movie would be about America and the constitution. / It would talk about the struggles of the constitution and the difficulty to get it approved by all the delegates and all the states. / Especially New York. Because they were very stubborn. / It would also talk about the taxes made on commerce by the British and the fights that the Americans have with the British. / It would also have to talk about avoiding corruption and how to do it. / Government needs to be something that manages a series of different situations. / George Washington would be a huge key in this movie I would want to make. / And it would have to include various patriots like John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, Alexander Hamilton and Madison / It would also need to include the fact that the king of England is very stubborn and doesn't budge. / Who thinks that the Americans are still not part of a new country but of his own. / One that still continues to tax American goods. / Also, it would talk about the need for the government of the Articles of Confederation to be changed because it just isn't going to work out. / It would talk about the constitution being ratified so narrowly. And it would talk about the need for unity between the states and a powerful enough central government. / There will be rebellion in many places and it would show that under the Articles of Confederation the central government wasn't able to fight back. / And so they would gather together and revise the articles of Confederation. But they actually end up throwing it away and changing it completely. / And they use the state constitutions and results as test cases or examples of how to form the new government / Also, the only way a convention would happen is if George Washington would show up which he didn't feel like showing up because he didn't want to have anymore lime light. / I think Washington was just being dramatic because he was very much like that. / George Washington loved theatre and so I think he was acting. / I'm sure he also was just really tired from everything that was going on / Forming a new government after a revolution would be very hard / And if Washington didn't show up to the convention of 1787 things wouldn't work out. / But thankfully he did come. In the end he decided to. / And we find out later that it is very important that they have this convention and that is was successful even though it was so close to being a failure. / 	2018-10-28T05:06:17Z

I just have to eat them. / Also, what did you say about annexing Canada? / Oh never mind. I'll keep talking about boring government politics. / So, have you ever met Benjamin Franklin? / He's a super cool guy. And he likes inventing new things / And having fun (like most people) / Something super important is to understand that the delegates in this meeting were all important because their votes all counted / Madison brought a plan and helped people get on board with it / He wanted to abolish the articles of Confederation / He talks about separation of powers / And checks and balances / Government politics is a very complicated thing / I would not want to be a political science major / I couldn't do it. / Also, it's needed that the states be represented by population. / So that the small states aren't more powerful than the big states / Man, I'm so tired. / It hit me like a wall. / But I'm going to sleep like a baby. / It's going to be wicked awesome. / Benjamin Franklin is a wicked awesome person. / And really funny. / So, during this convention...there were a lot of rules. / And it took sooo much time to get any thing done or passed by the convention. They had to vote so many times and most times it didn't get anywhere. / They had to adjust the articles of Confederation so that it worked according to how it had been created not as it had been working (because it hadn't been working very well). / Madison was some form of scribe during the Convention / People did not understand the Virginia Plan as it was presented. / This was a huge turning point in our country's history. / And our founding fathers had to put so much effort and debate into it. / It was so close to not succeeding. / Factions and republics are also talked about. / All societies are made up of some sort of faction. / Whether it be religion, culture, race, etc / But they all have their own opinions and want their own things to happen in government. / The thirteen states were represented in the convention. These states were New York. Massachusetts, Delaware, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, Rhode Island, Viong / Virginia, among others. / They also made some compromises that don't make much sense at all. / Like the slave issues that came up in the meeting. / The people not the states need to be represented. / The small states fought against the large states. / And the large states fought against the small states. It was a very complicated issue / The Carolinas and Georgia insisted that the importation of slaves continues. / Northern states talked about how slaves are people, not second class citizensz / Also most people in the convention were motivated by their own self interest and powe. / Power / British merchants started the slave trade. And America should end itZ / Slaves were a huge influence in the constitution. The whole south was very stubborn about this fact. They insisted that slave trade had to continue for another 20 years. / Madison didn't agree with slave trade. He thought it was very wrong. / Also, many argued that the people needed to be those who approve the laws or to deny the laws. / This was so that tyranny would be avoided. / So the power needed to stay in the hands of the people. / I think this is why it is so important that citizens choose to inform themselves and vote on important issues. / Thank goodness we have such a wicked awesome government organizationZ / Both the small states and the large states were very stubborn. / They didn't want to compromise at all. / But roger Sherman devised a part that involved both of the interests of the small states and the large states. / But they didn't like that idea at first. Which made it very difficultX / . / It was a little complicated about the rules that went into the convention / They had to say ""aye"" or ""nay"" to vote. And they would say with dissent if they disagreed. / The chairman also had to give permission for someone to speak / If they spoke out of Turn they would get silenced. / turn* / They also needed a majority to have the votes go through and actually get approved. / There were so many different ideas being sent out in the mertingZ / Meeting / But all the sacrifice of the founding fathers was for us the people. Their future. / I personally think they did a really good job. Our government isn't perfect but it's something really really good. / Wicked awesome is a way to describe it if you live in New England. / The best England. / England is a cool place but New England is the better one. It's like the 2.0 of countries. / New England also survives worse winters. / We are stronger. / And we speaker with a wicked awesome accent. / I have no idea what else to talk about. / I'm running out of ideas and thoughts. Probably because I'm so tired. / I'm sure the transportation for this convention I was talking about would be hard. It was probably horse and buggy but it would take so many hours to get from New York to Pen. / Imagine Seattle to NYC. That would take months I feel like. / At least weeks. Maybe not months. / I guess it depends how slow you take the trip. / If you stay in a hotel it would take a lot longer. / Especially because of the really nice continental breakfast they give you. / And the beds are usually really nice. / Hopefully you have the money for it all or else it would be very hard. / There would also be really good costumer service. That's a necessary thing. / It's a super important part of the marketing of a company. / If a company doesn't have good costumer service not much else matters because that is so important. / Also, usually there is a pool and you get to swim. / I love swimming. / And I love potatoes. / They are wicked awesome. / Also the new towels are great. / It's really hard to do things when you're tired. Sleep tight! / Don't let the bed bugs bite! / "	2018-10-28T06:07:26Z

It was pretty cool. / I didn't buy any ink though because I didn't have enough money. / I was only in like third grade so... / Did you take a nap or something? / Where did you go? / I still have some homework I have to finish, but I don't want to do it. / I have to write a paper and finish some chemistry. / The midterms  were crazy yesterday. / Are you still there? / It'd be kind of weird if you were still reading all of this, but just weren't responding. / I don't really mind though. I'm kind of good at rambling I guess. / Do you want to proof read my essay? / I bet that'll put you to sleep. / I wrote about fashion and its influences. / I ate all of my carrots so now I want something else to eat. / I'm kind of thirsty actually. / Maybe I'll have some orange juice or something. / Apple juice sounds really good right now. / Or maybe some apple cider. / My brother is wearing plaid right now. / Are you there? / My house mate just poured me some apple cider. It was very good. / I love apple juice. I tried to be sly and offer it to someone but they didn't get the hint and ask for some so I didn't get to share with them. / It was still good though. / That was last year. / Now, I try to impress them with my art. / Are you still there? / Should I send some help? / I'm a little concerned. / I don't even know you but I feel responsible for your well being because I was probably the last person you were talking too. / Just kidding, hopefully you are okay. / I think I have tendonitis and typing a lot does not help it. / It makes my elbow hurt. I know that sounds weird but its true. / I feel bad because I was supposed to type up a bunch of generated random numbers for a group project, but I forgot and someone else already did it by the time I got home. / I was at the church building. / That is where I had my desserts because the church always has refreshments, not that it's a bad thing. I'm just saying. / At least I had some vegetables to balance it out. / It probably doesn't work that way though. / Since you don't seem to be here anymore, I might just end the chat. / It's almost time for me to go to bed anyways. / I also should get some stuff done. / My brother dropped his pencil. / I don't know why I felt the need to tell you. / I feel like I'm just talking to myself because you are not responding. / If you do come back from your bathroom break, please do not go through all of the effort of reading everything I typed. / I don't think it is worth your time. / You know as they say, ""Time is money."" / Who is they, because I do not know. / Okay, I better give my tendonitis arms a break. / Nice chatting with you though. / I hope you have a nice rest of the day. / I guess evening. / I need to go to bed now. / Bye. / "	2018-11-08T03:02:59Z

That sounds super interesting. So are you wanting to write books or what kind of publishing are you wanting to get into after graduating? / A lot of my extended family have written books! Mostly my grandpa / My cousin actually just wrote a futuristic  fiction book that sounds pretty interesting.

We just made it up last week and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it! / My wife usually does the cooking and makes up these amazing recipes and I do most of the baking. I really love to bake probably because I really enjoy science. / I guess you kind of have to enjoy science when you are taking so many science classes. Dental school has pretty strict science requirements. / Did you have to take any science classes for your generals? If so, what was your favorite? My favorite science class so far has been physics! It is just so fun and I just feel / Like it is pretty easy for me to understand. / Surprisingly enough, I have two professors for that class. It's a couple! I have never had a class like that before! Have you ever had a couple teach any of your classes? / I was curious, so I just looked up how much BYU professors earn and it's actually really good! If both husband and wife are Professor, they make quite a good living. / I don't know why I was curious. I've never even thought about becoming a professor. But maybe someday it would be pretty rewarding to be able to give back and teach at a denta / School. My cousin's husband is going to school to be a professor of the Spanish language. Actually I think he actually wants to teach / Professors how to teach the language. It is a pretty cool concept. They are living in Minnesota right now and just had there fourth child. / Our babies are 6 months apart. I wish they lived closer so we could have play dates. / It's kind of sad because all of my son's cousins live in a different state.

So that was an advantage because she now can focus on being a mom. / I'm not saying that you should drop out of college. Education is important too. / But I do know people that have their families first and then go back to school later. And it all works out for them. / We just decided that family was going to come first. Before anything. So we did it and took the leap. / We got pregnant and then applied for Medicaid to pay the expenses. / Everything was covered 100% from the pre natal doctors visits to the delivery room. It was a huge blessing. / So I guess that's my second piece of advice of why having kids in school is good. You are much more likely to qualify for government aid. / Plus, it's fun to have young parents as a kid. At least I think so. / So we didn't want to wait until we were done with school at all (especially because we are going to dental school and would be close to 30 by the time all was said and done.) / The medical and scientific evidence for having kids in your 20s is also strong. It's much healthier for your body. / Plus you never know if it might take longer for you because of some issue, so if it does you don't want to find out at 29 and have less time to deal with it. / But the main reason (And i'm sorry if any of this sounded scary) is just that it is a commandment. They even said in general conference that Satan tries to discourage worthy / parents from having kids. Because he wants to stop God's plan from moving forward and that is one big way to do that. / Anyway, I've rambled enough about this. Bottom line: Kids are awesome and God will provide a way for everything to work out if you act in faith. / 	2018-10-24T20:46:20Z

Lots of various items hang from the hook, old and hardly used keys, lanyards, and you reach for a specific item and take it off / Its a long red dog leash / Fairly old, and looking like its been chewed up a fair amount / As your hand lifts the leash from the cluttered hook, suddenly your thoughts are interuppted by an ecstatic golden retreiver bounding into the room / You quicly clip on the leash to the dog's collar, and open your front door / As you step outside you are greeted by the chill air, slowly getting warmer from the sluggish sun on the horizon / You make sure to close and lock your door, and then head out, through the small, still asleep neoghborhood / You go on a longer than usual walk, making sure to enjoy the silence and brisk air before it is gone for the day / After nearly an entire hour of walking, you're nearly back to your house / You notice a lot more people out and about now than when you left / You make sure to wave to your three-house-down neoghbor Frank who is cutting his lawn.

Starting with going and visiting Europe. And then probably going to Asia. / I think it would be cool to see France, Spain, Italy, Russia, Greece. You know. The typical ones. / And then I could go visit Turkey and Bosnia and then head over to Asia. / Then I could visit Nepal, Thailand, China and Japan. / Those are all super cool countries. / And it would not be a cheap trip because I would try all the foods of those cultures and countries. So this would probably take about 10 years to do depending on how long / I want to stay in each country / I would also have to go see different monuments and the typical touristy things. / And I would need to do a lot of exercise so I dont get super fat. / Obviously the food is the best part. / Also I would probably want to take my brother or someone to have some company or else it would be very boring I think. / So...what would you do? Where would you go? What would be the best part? Anything you would look forward to if you did a trip like the one that I described? / Also, if you had all the money in the world, would you go on a trip around the world or would you do something else? / Also, what is or favorite flavor of ice cream? / I think chocolate mint is wicked good. / And I would need to try all the types of food in Italy. Especially all the different types of pizza. / Not just the plain pizzas but the really extravagant ones. / And I would need to exercise a lot. Probably in all of the countries I'd be in, I would need a gym membership. / I might also need security guards for some of the more dangerous countries around the world / Also, they would need to be well trained just because you don't want some crazy guy as your security guard. / They would probably be really buff guys. Maybe even Russians / Maybe I hired them along the way on the trip. / Also, what is your absolute favorite food? / Oh! If I went to Spain I would eat all the Spanish food possible there. / Fabada, cachopo, chorizo, paella, mariscos / those are all super good types of food. / Also, I would have to go the the Canary Islands and eat mojo and papas canarias / And gofio with honey and milk. / And drink clipper everyday for weeks while staying on the beach. / There are a lot of hippies that live on the beaches there but I wouldn't do that. I would live in a hotel or an apartment. / I would probably go and stay in Tenerife. / That would be really cool. / Or you could say wicked awesome too. / Also, do you know why the fish is super expensive on the Canary Islands?? / They import all of it! How ridiculous! Because they also fish there. / So its a little crazy / it's / I would have to go to Galicia and eat octopus and caldo gallego. / And go to Ponferrada to eat food typical of the Bierzo. Like botillo. It's a pig bladder stuffed with chorizo and pig tail and sometimes tongue. / It sounds terrible but it is actually really really good. / I would have to do a huge tour of Spain because there is so much to do there. / Also I would go to a barcalona verus Real Madrid game. Those get intense. / But, money is an object so all these dreams are pretty extreme. / But it would be sooooooo cool! / I'm wondering how I can make it possible. / Have you ever been to Spain? Most people here think it is a third world country but it's a super nice country. / Their economy isn't the greatest right now but it's getting better I think. / Or at least I hope that it is getting better... / So, have you ever been to Spain? / You have to go see it! / Well visit it. And stay awhile. Because it's a lot of fun. There's a lot of cool architecture to see from earlier centuries. / Would that interest you? / I got to go! See you! / 	2018-10-22T19:25:22Z

I think from early on students in Math should be allowed a little more exploration. / Other sciences often have fun or cool experiments where students can just play around and observe neat things, and then they come back to talk about theories and principles that apply to those experiments / You never see something like that in a Math class, which I admit can be tough because it can be very theoretical, but you can still design ways for students to try and figure things out on their own. / 	2018-04-11T02:48:48Z

Instead of asking students to memorize equations to calculate areas, volumes, perimeters, angles, etc. You could enable students the opportunity to play with different shapes / And try and have the students discover these formulas, after playing with different types of triangles, see if students can come up with the fact that the area of a triangle is one-half multiplied by the base, and multiplied by the height. / Sorry I know that's probably a huge information overload, but it's such a huge topic that I think is essential for our education system to figure out / 	2018-04-11T02:52:15Z

Excuse my mistypes. / But they taste great when you are starving that's for sure. / I also love ice cream. / And gelato / Gelato is way better than ice cream though / It's a lot more rich and it is denser. I like the texture more. Yellow cake batter is the best. / And mint brownies is good too. / And cookies and cream. / What is your favorite type of ice cream? / I think you would really enjoy the ones that I like. Because they are the best flavors for sure. / 	2018-11-11T05:47:14Z

Pure logic points towards social darwinism and that is super super bad. So a / computer purely based in logic would fail its purpose. / And why would a computer need to vote in the first place?

So like how does one ""keep it real""? / I know thats what the kids are saying nowadays...But I haven't quite caught up to the trends of the whippersnappers. / I love talking like I'm an old Grandpa. / It's hard to imagine Grandpas as young people and that they probably thought they were ""hip"" / I bet they used different words back then though. I wonder what some of them were... / Groovy was too late for that generation. / It would have to be the 30s and 40s. / So I guess most of the population was in that whole ""war time"" mentality. So they are a lot more serious and careful about things. / Just because they had to. / Thats how they grew up. And how you grow up affects how you are for the rest of your life. / Isn't that a weird concept? Like what if you get a dealt a bad hand and you grow up super bad and then you are screwed for the rest of your life. / Although I guess that there are people that come from humble beginnings that make it to the big leagues just by grit and determination. / taylor's grandma grew up in Germany in the War. She was homeless for a long time, had to hide from the Soldiers, and ate food off the street. / So she had this scarcity mentality and that has followed her for the rest of her life. / Now she is a missionary though, and she is learning spanish. So you really never know where you life is going to take you. / She still makes mean German Food though. I love German Food. I want to go to Germany. / "	2018-11-02T01:48:04Z

What really matters is that you find someone that has family as the number one goal. Someone who is / going to be a good mother. / Because this decision is going to impact not only your life, but the life of your kids forever. Thats the hard thing about being married, is that all the decisions you make no / longer affect you. They affect many more people down the line. / So that would be my advice to you for dating and relationships. / So now you just have to start becoming that person that you want.
