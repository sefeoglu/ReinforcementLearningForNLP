Levitate objects? Can they only be summoned by a maidenly touch? Are they fully sentient?

Possibly with the mediation of m / *magic / Alternatively, they could be closely related to humans, but have achieved a higher degree of intelligence and/or technological development, possibly co-opting genetically / altered horse forms to take control of when their humanoid ones die. / 	2018-05-07T22:04:22Z

If we're talking about a magic allele, then I would think of magic as a sort of additional or enhanced sense, not a form of energy. / Similar to the magnetic sense experienced by many magical creatures, or the way a mantis shrimp can see a far wider spectrum of color than you or I. / It's hard to see how an allele would confer the ability to manipulate a certain form of energy. / A buildup of genetic differences might do it. Think a horse population isolated for centuries in an environment that encourages interaction with energy in an unusual way. / Sorry, magnetic sense experienced by many *migratory* creatures / 	2018-05-07T22:15:06Z
